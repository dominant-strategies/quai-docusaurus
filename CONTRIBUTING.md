## How To Contribute

The Quai Network docs are built with [Docusarus 3](https://docusaurus.io/docs) and written using Markdown and MDX.

To contribute to the Quai documentation, you'll need to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), [commit your changes to your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository), and [create an upstream pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with your changes. This will allow for open-sourced, collaborative review of all changes before they are merged into the main branch.

In the effort of maintaining the quality and integrity of the Quai Network documentation, all changes require:

- DS Team approval: All changes to this repository must be approved by the Dominant Strategies team before being merged into the main branch.
- Passing CI: All changes must pass the CI checks before being merged into the main branch.
- Conversation: Reach out to the DS team directly on the [Quai Dev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/s8y8asPwNC) to discuss your proposed changes.
