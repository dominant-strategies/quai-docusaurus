# Example Supply Growth

:::info
Quai and Qi supply will be determined in relation to the growth of the network as well as the miner reward selection and conversions between them. As such, the below are **merely hypothetical examples** to demonstrate the **potential** effect of certain token mechanics, and are **not expectations or projections**. 
:::

These illustrative examples assume:
* Miners take 100% of block reward in Quai rather than any in Qi, and that there is no net effect of conversions between the two.
* Varying network difficulty growth rates based on Bitcoin’s growth:
  * **Example 1**: Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, extrapolating that same growth rate over an additional 7 years.
  * **Example 2**: also Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, but spreads it out over 20 years.
  * **Example 3**: Bitcoin’s growth between 2011 through 2016, spread out over 20 years.

These examples also take into account the [3 billion initial Quai tokens minted and allocated in the genesis block](/learn/tokenomics/genesis-allocations/genesis-allocations.md).
