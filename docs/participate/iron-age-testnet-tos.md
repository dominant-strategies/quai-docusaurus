The Quai Testnet is designed to improve the operational experience, security, and design of the Quai mainnet protocol and to expose potential issues and to improve participant experiences prior to the launch of the Quai mainnet.

We are under no obligation to accept any individual as a user of the Services, and may accept or reject any account registration in our sole and complete discretion.

16. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and our officers, directors, employees, successors, licensees, and assigns harmless from and against any claims, actions, or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from (i) breach of any of your representations, warranties, or other obligations under these Terms of Use; (ii) your use or misuse of the Services; and (iii) your gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.

17. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS

The Services are based in the United States. We make no claims concerning whether any content may be downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United States. If you access or use Services from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk. Whether inside or outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.

18. TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate these Terms or Use and/or restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services, at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Services at any time without prior notice or liability.

19. BINDING ARBITRATION

Subject to Section 21 below, in the event of a dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Use (“Dispute”), such Dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside, or, if you reside outside of the United States, the arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in these Terms of Use will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.

20. CLASS ACTION WAIVER

You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

21. EQUITABLE RELIEF

You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights or confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce these Terms of Use. We may, without waiving any other remedies under these Terms of Use, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of New York for purposes of any such action by us.

22. MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms of Use and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Proceedings commenced by us to protect our intellectual property or confidential information shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York.

If the Agreement is terminated, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect: “Intellectual Property,” “Confidentiality; Feedback,” “Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability,” “Assumption of the Risk Relating to Blockchain,” “Indemnification,” “Compliance with Applicable Laws,” “Termination of the Agreement,” “Binding Arbitration,” “Class Action Waiver,” “Equitable Relief,” and “Miscellaneous.”

Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Terms of Use. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, these Terms of Use, together with our Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and us, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between you and us, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. These Terms of Use will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees. These Terms of Use may be updated by us from time to time, with reasonable notice to you, including via transmission of such updated terms via electronic means.
