A Stratum proxy is a tool in cryptocurrency mining that connects miners' hardware (GPU rigs) to their personal blockchain nodes or a pool's node. The main role of a Stratum Proxy is to improve mining efficiency by streamlining the data exchange process.

In technical terms, the Stratum proxy takes block data from the miner's node, turns it into workable formats, and sends it to the mining hardware. It then collects the completed work and sends it back to the node. This process reduces network traffic and ensures miners consistently work on the latest tasks, which is essential for effective mining operations.
