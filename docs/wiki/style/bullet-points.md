### Guidelines

- List items should be consistent, either all complete sentences or all fragments.
- Always use punctuation at the end of list items if they are complete sentences.
- Don't use bullet points for a single sentence or fragment.
- Don't add extra spacing or indentation between list items unless it is necessary for clarity.

Other recommended, **but not required**, practices for bullet points can be found in the [APA Style Guidelines Blog](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/lists/bulleted)
