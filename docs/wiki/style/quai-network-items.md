- Any usage of "Quai" or "Quai Network" should always be capitalized.
- Pieces of the Quai Network architecture (e.g zone, region, slice) should not be capitalized unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.
- All Quai Network specific items should be written in the present tense. For example, "Quai is a decentralized network" instead of "Quai was a decentralized network".
- Products, whether Quai related or 3rd party (e.g. QuaiScan, Pelagus, NodeJS, etc.) should capitalized appropriately.
- References to Quai repositories or packages don't need to be capitalized, but should be hyperlinked and code blocked, like [`go-quai`](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai) or [`quai-gpu-miner`](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner).
