## Guidelines

- Page titles should be descriptive and concise; **not more than 40 characters** to fit in the sidebar.
- Page titles **should be able to stand alone** and make sense to a user without the context of the docs hierarchy. Remember, users _can land on any page in the docs via search_.
- Headings should use [**Title Case**](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case) (capitalize all words except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions).
- **Never skip heading levels** (e.g., don't use an `###` after an `#`).
- Headings should never be punctuated.
- Always use the **infinitive verb form** in headings (e.g., "Deploy on Quai" instead of "Deploying on Quai").
- When applicable, pages should have a single `## Introduction` heading with a brief summary of the page content.
- Headings **should have blank lines above and below them**. This makes markdown pages render correctly and improves readability.
- Headings should always have a space between the `#` and the heading text. Markdown will not recognize the heading if there is no space.
