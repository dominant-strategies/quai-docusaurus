- There are two correct ways to refer to Quai Network: **"Quai" or "Quai Network"**.
  - Do not use the phrasing _"The Quai Network" or "The Quai"_.
- **Write articles and tutorials in the second person**, using "you" and "your" to refer to the reader. This makes the documentation more approachable and easier to follow for users of any experience level.
- Use **bolding** and _italics_ meaning fully, generally only to **emphasize** a word or phrase or to _indicate_ a variable.
- **Do not use underlining**. Underlining is reserved for links.
