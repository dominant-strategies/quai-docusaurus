## Internal Links

Internal links are links to other pages within the documentation. When using internal links, **always use root relative file paths**, e.g. `/wiki/style/links.md`. **Never use relative file paths**, e.g. `../style/links.md`. While both path types will break links when files are moved, root relative file paths make it significantly easier (on you and our team) to find and fix when this happens.
