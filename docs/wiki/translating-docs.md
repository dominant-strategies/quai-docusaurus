## Overview

Docusaurus v3 supports internationalization via [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization). Future support for translations will be added to the Quai docs according to the [Docusaurus i18n workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization).
